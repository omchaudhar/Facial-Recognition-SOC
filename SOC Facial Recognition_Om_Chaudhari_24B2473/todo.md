## Todo List

### Phase 2: Plan and design the application structure
- [x] Outline the application architecture
- [x] Identify key technologies and libraries
- [x] Define data flow and component interactions
- [x] Document the design plan

### Phase 3: Set up development environment and install dependencies
- [x] Install necessary software (Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Kivy, etc.)
- [x] Create virtual environment
- [x] Install Python packages

### Phase 4: Implement data collection and preprocessing
- [x] Implement script for collecting facial data
- [x] Preprocess collected data (resizing, normalization, etc.)

### Phase 5: Train deep learning model
- [x] Build Siamese Neural Network model
- [x] Train the model using collected data
- [x] Evaluate model performance

### Phase 6: Develop the facial recognition application
- [x] Implement real-time prediction with OpenCV
- [x] Build Kivy GUI for the application

### Phase 7: Test and debug the application
- [x] Conduct unit tests
