## Application Architecture

The facial recognition application will be a desktop application built with Python. The architecture will consist of the following components:

*   **Data Collection:** A module to capture images from a webcam and store them for training.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** A module to process the captured images, including resizing, cropping, and converting to grayscale.
*   **Model Training:** A module to train a Siamese Neural Network using the preprocessed data. This network will learn to distinguish between different faces.
*   **Real-time Recognition:** A module to capture video from a webcam, detect faces in real-time, and use the trained model to recognize the faces.
*   **User Interface:** A graphical user interface (GUI) built with Kivy to provide a user-friendly way to interact with the application.



## Key Technologies and Libraries

Based on the YouTube playlist, the following key technologies and libraries will be utilized:

*   **Python:** The primary programming language for the entire application.
*   **OpenCV:** Used for real-time video capture, face detection, and image manipulation.
*   **TensorFlow/Keras:** For building and training the deep learning model (Siamese Neural Network).
*   **Numpy:** For numerical operations, especially array manipulation.
*   **Kivy:** For developing the cross-platform graphical user interface.
*   **Scikit-image:** Potentially for additional image processing tasks.



## Data Flow and Component Interactions

The application's data flow and component interactions can be summarized as follows:

1.  **User Interaction (Kivy GUI):** The user interacts with the application through the Kivy GUI to initiate data collection, start real-time recognition, or view results.
2.  **Webcam Input (OpenCV):** When data collection or real-time recognition is initiated, OpenCV captures video frames from the webcam.
3.  **Face Detection (OpenCV):** For each captured frame, OpenCV's Haar Cascades or a similar pre-trained model will be used to detect faces.
4.  **Image Preprocessing:** Detected faces are then preprocessed (resized, normalized, converted to grayscale) using OpenCV and NumPy.
5.  **Data Storage:** During data collection, preprocessed face images are saved to a designated directory.
6.  **Model Training (TensorFlow/Keras):** When sufficient data is collected, the Siamese Neural Network is trained using TensorFlow/Keras. The training data consists of pairs of images (anchor, positive, negative) to learn similarity and dissimilarity.
7.  **Feature Extraction (Trained Model):** During real-time recognition, detected and preprocessed faces are fed into the trained Siamese Neural Network to extract embeddings (feature vectors).
8.  **Face Recognition (Comparison):** The extracted embedding of the current face is compared with a database of known face embeddings (e.g., using Euclidean distance) to identify the person.
9.  **Display Results (Kivy GUI):** The recognition results (e.g., recognized name, bounding box around face) are displayed on the Kivy GUI in real-time.





## Dataset Requirements for Siamese Neural Network

For training a Siamese Neural Network, the dataset needs to be structured in a specific way to facilitate learning of similarity and dissimilarity between faces. Typically, it involves:

*   **Anchor Images:** A reference image of a person.
*   **Positive Images:** Another image of the *same* person as the anchor.
*   **Negative Images:** An image of a *different* person than the anchor.

The network learns to minimize the distance between anchor and positive pairs, and maximize the distance between anchor and negative pairs. Therefore, the dataset should contain multiple images for each individual, allowing for the creation of these triplets (anchor, positive, negative) during the training process. The more diverse the images (different expressions, lighting, angles), the more robust the trained model will be.
