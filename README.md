# Facial Recognition Security Operations Center (SOC) System

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Python-based Facial Recognition system developed as part of a Summer of Code (SOC) project. The system is designed for secure, real-time identity verification, integrating advanced neural networks with an intuitive user interface. It aims to enhance security protocols through accurate identification and verification of individuals, with primary applications in access control, surveillance, and incident response within a security operations framework. The project emphasizes modularity, detailed documentation, and scalability.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Identity Verification:** Utilizes live video feeds or captured images for instant facial recognition.
*   **Advanced Machine Learning Models:** Employs neural networks (e.g., CNNs) for high accuracy in facial detection and recognition.
*   **Intuitive User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring recognition events, managing user profiles, and configuring system settings.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle varying loads and integrate with existing security infrastructures.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed explanations of the system architecture, installation, usage, and underlying algorithms.

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run the Facial Recognition SOC system, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/omchaudhar/Facial-Recognition-SOC.git
    cd Facial-Recognition-SOC/SOC\ Facial\ Recognition_Om_Chaudhari_24B2473
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

To run the main application via the command line:

```bash
python facial_recognition_app.py
```

This will present a menu with options:

1.  Collect face data - Capture images for training.
2.  Start real-time recognition - Begin face recognition.
3.  Exit

### Kivy GUI Application

To run the graphical user interface:

```bash
python kivy_app.py
```

The GUI provides a camera preview, data collection interface, and real-time recognition controls.

## How It Works

1.  **Face Detection**: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time.
2.  **Data Collection**: Captures and stores face images for each person.
3.  **Face Recognition**: Employs template matching to compare detected faces with stored data.
4.  **User Interface**: Offers both command-line and graphical interfaces for interaction.

## Limitations

*   The current implementation uses basic template matching for face recognition, which is less accurate than deep learning approaches.
*   Camera access may not function in all environments (e.g., virtual machines or containers).
*   Recognition accuracy is influenced by lighting conditions and face angles.
*   Advanced features such as face verification or anti-spoofing are not yet implemented.

## Future Enhancements

*   Integration with external security systems (e.g., CCTV, access control hardware).
*   Implementation of liveness detection to prevent spoofing attacks.
*   Development of a robust database for storing facial embeddings and user data.
*   Cloud deployment options for scalable and distributed operations.
*   Implement deep learning-based face recognition (e.g., Siamese Neural Networks).
*   Add face verification capabilities.
*   Improve recognition accuracy with more advanced algorithms.
*   Implement real-time performance optimizations.
