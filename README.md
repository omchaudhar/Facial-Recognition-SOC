# Python Programming and Machine Learning Midterm Checkpoint

This repository contains a comprehensive report on Python programming and an introduction to machine learning, along with practical code examples and a list of resources used during the learning process.

## Repository Structure

*   `report.pdf`: A detailed PDF report summarizing Python basics, essential modules (os, sys, datetime, json, re), data science libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), and an introduction to neural network algorithms. This report is over 10 pages long and includes code blocks and insights.

*   `python_code/`:
    *   `python_basics/`: Contains Python code examples covering fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, control flow (if/else, loops), and functions.
    *   `modules/`: Contains Python code examples demonstrating the usage of essential built-in modules like `os`, `sys`, `datetime`, `json`, and `re`, as well as data science libraries `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib`.
    *   `neural_networks/`: Contains a conceptual Python code example illustrating a simple neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.

*   `resources.md`: A Markdown file listing all the YouTube tutorials and official documentation links that were used as learning resources.

## Report Overview

The `report.pdf` document provides an in-depth look into the following topics:

*   **Python Basics:** Covers fundamental syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and the concept of modules and packages.
*   **Essential Python Modules:** Explores the utility of `os`, `sys`, `datetime`, `json`, and `re` modules for various programming tasks.
*   **Data Science Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib):** Details the core functionalities of these libraries for numerical computation, data manipulation, and data visualization, respectively, with practical code examples and insights into concepts like NumPy broadcasting.
*   **Neural Network Algorithms:** Introduces the basic architecture of neural networks, the backpropagation learning algorithm, common activation functions, and a conceptual example using Keras. It also discusses key insights and challenges associated with neural networks.
