# Facial Recognition Security Operations Center (SOC) System

This repository hosts a Python-based Facial Recognition system designed for secure, real-time identity verification. Developed as part of a Summer of Code (SOC) project, this system integrates advanced neural networks with an intuitive user interface, providing robust capabilities for monitoring and managing access in security operations center environments. The project emphasizes detailed documentation for ease of understanding, deployment, and scalability.

## Project Overview

The Facial Recognition SOC system aims to enhance security protocols by leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques to accurately identify and verify individuals. Its primary applications include access control, surveillance, and incident response within a security operations framework. The system is built with modularity in mind, allowing for future expansions and integrations with other security tools.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Identity Verification:** Utilizes live video feeds or captured images for instant facial recognition.
*   **Advanced Machine Learning Models:** Employs neural networks (e.g., CNNs) for high accuracy in facial detection and recognition.
*   **Intuitive User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring recognition events, managing user profiles, and configuring system settings.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle varying loads and integrate with existing security infrastructures.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed explanations of the system architecture, installation, usage, and underlying algorithms.

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run the Facial Recognition SOC system, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/omchaudhar/Facial-Recognition-SOC.git
    cd Facial-Recognition-SOC
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming a requirements.txt will be provided or created
    ```
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is not currently present in the repository. It is recommended to create one by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all necessary libraries.)*

4.  **Run the application:**
    *(Specific instructions for running the facial recognition system will be provided here once the application's entry point is identified.)*

## Usage

*(Detailed instructions on how to use the facial recognition system, including how to configure it, add new users, and monitor events, will be provided here.)*

## Future Enhancements

*   Integration with external security systems (e.g., CCTV, access control hardware).
*   Implementation of liveness detection to prevent spoofing attacks.
*   Development of a robust database for storing facial embeddings and user data.
*   Cloud deployment options for scalable and distributed operations.
